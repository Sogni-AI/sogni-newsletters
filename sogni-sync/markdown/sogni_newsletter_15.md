---

Hi Sognians!

The team has been heads-down shipping nonstop since our last update, and the results speak for themselves. We’ve massively upgraded the Supernet’s capabilities, expanded our global presence, and rewarded thousands of you for helping us build this ecosystem. Here’s the high-level summary of what we’ve accomplished together.

**For Artists & Creators:**

**For Workers & Stakers:**

**For Our Community & Partners:**

That’s the summary, but the real magic is in the details. Dive in below to see exactly how these new tools can transform your workflow and what our community has already started creating with them. Keep building.

- **Four Game-Changing Models:** A new suite of creative tools is now at your fingertips, led by the revolutionary [Flux.1 Kontext](https://x.com/Sogni_Protocol/status/1960315807931494808) for [editing](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-studio/basics/kontext) and [remixing](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-studio/basics/kontext/mixing-two-reference-images) images with plain English, [Flux.1 Krea](https://x.com/Sogni_Protocol/status/1961070783133893027) for photorealism, and two versions of Chroma (v46 [flash] for rapid exploration and v48 [detail] for final assets).
- **Seamless Web2 Payments:** [Premium Spark](https://docs.sogni.ai/supernet/sogni-token-vs-spark-points/about-premium-spark-points) is live, enabling you to purchase render credits with any credit/debit card in **195 countries and 135 currencies**—no crypto wallet needed.
- **Photobooth Upgrades:** The [Sogni Photobooth](https://photobooth.sogni.ai/) app, a hit at our global events, has been upgraded with Kontext for fun group photos and Krea for beautiful upscaling and enhancement.
- **Expanded Model Library:** We've shipped **12 new Stable Diffusion models** to both the Relaxed and Fast Supernets for even more artistic styles.

- **Leaderboard Payouts:** The 30 million SOGNI from Season 1 have been airdropped, and the 10 million SOGNI from Season 2 will be claimable starting October 6th.
- **Airdrop Season 3 is Live:** A new season has started with another [10 million SOGNI](https://x.com/Sogni_Protocol/status/1970457627780870235) up for grabs, with the largest portion of them going to the staking leaderboard.
- **New Fast Worker Dashboard:** Fast Workers can now see a daily breakdown of their earnings by token type to better track their leaderboard performance.
- **Next-Gen GPU Support:** The Fast Worker client now supports the latest **Nvidia series 50 Blackwell GPUs, including the RTX 5090**.
- **Fast Worker NFTs Sold Out:** All **999 Mainnet Fast Worker Prospect NFT licenses** have been claimed, showing incredible demand to power the Supernet.

Now, we are in [Singapore in force for TOKEN2049](https://luma.com/dreamhaus)!
- **Fostering New Developers:** We co-sponsored a major hackathon with [Base and Virtuals Protocol](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/cctf/news-events/news/detail/blockchain-ntu-x-base-hackathon-finals-successfully-conclude--showcasing-student-innovation) at one of the world's top engineering schools, NTU.
- **Aethir Partnership:** We’ve partnered with fellow DePIN leader [Aethir](https://ecosystem.aethir.com/blog-posts/sogni-aethir-powering-creative-ai-with-decentralized-cloud-computing) on an epic community airdrop and NFT collection, which has now concluded.

## Meet Your New Secret Weapons 🤫

Meet the models for every stage of creation:

- **Kontext** lets you start from any image and make precise, plain-English edits while **preserving identity and character consistency**.
- **Krea [dev]** delivers tasteful, commercially-ready photorealism (industry-leading natural skin, natural light, strong text).
- **Chroma v48 [detail]** pushes unconstrained creativity with exquisite micro-detail for final assets; and Chroma v46 [flash] is the turbo sibling for rapid exploration, full creative range.
- In addition, Kontext has Built-in power tools (Auto-Refresh, Kontext-Fill, two-image blend) which let you stack targeted edits fast without rebuilding the whole scene.

*Note: **FLUX Kontext** and **Flux Krea** only run on the Fast Supernet as premium licensed models which require Premium Spark or SOGNI token to use.*

## Recap: The NTU Hackathon 🎓

[Sogni SDK](https://sdk-docs.sogni.ai/) took center stage as we sponsored [NTU's Web3 Hackathon with Base and Virtual Protocol](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/cctf/news-events/news/detail/blockchain-ntu-x-base-hackathon-finals-successfully-conclude--showcasing-student-innovation) (a top #4 engineering school globally!)

Students had one week to build the gen AI app of their dreams for a shot at $4,200 in prizes. Submissions were competitive, from [Dungeons & Dragons character profile creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVWM6PlRU04) to a [Localized Fashion Lookbook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffiowr_zu98), the students knocked it out of the park. The top teams were given a token grant to continue their work and potentially be featured in Sogni's [Super Apps page](https://www.sogni.ai/super-apps). Stay tuned!

For the event, Team Sogni also vibe coded and open-sourced a "Tattoo Idea Generator" app that students can took apart and explored. It was written in only 8 hours!

## Season 3 Airdrop 🥳

The race continues: 10,000,000 SOGNI will go to the top 2,500 users across all leaderboards by the end of this season. You can enter the airdrop competition every 6 weeks!

🏁 Season 3 runs until Monday, November 3, at UTC Midnight.

**📊 Season 1 by the numbers:**

🎨 13,563 Artists 🤑 125 Stakers 🛀 184 Relaxed Workers ⚡ 428 Fast Workers

**📊 Season 2 by the numbers:**

🎨 2,500 Artists 🤑 563 Stakers 🛀 197 Relaxed Workers ⚡ 381 Fast Workers. Season 2 airdrops wlll be claimable on Oct 6

Congrats to everyone who ranked!

## Leaderboards: How to Rank 🎯

**🎨 Artists, your creation method matters:**

💻 **Workers:**

🔒 **Stakers:**

- Use Rewarded Spark Points → 1x points
- Use Premium Spark Points (purchased Spark) → 7x points
- Use SOGNI tokens → 10x points

- Your rank rises with every premium job your machine powers.
- New: to avoid free Daily Boost farming, only Premium Spark and SOGNI use results in leaderboard points for Workers.

- In Season 3, 30% of the airdrop is allocated to the staking leaderboard.
- The more SOGNI you stake, the greater your yield.

## For Our Pros: This One's for You 💪

This season, the stakes are higher. The Staking Leaderboard will receive the single largest allocation of the airdrop prize pool: a massive **33% of the 10 million SOGNI**. To help you maximize your rank, Fast Workers can now enable **‘auto-stake-your-earnings’** on the [Sogni Dashboard](https://dashboard.sogni.ai/). Activating this feature automatically boosts your SOGNI earnings by **17.65%**, giving you a significant competitive edge.

You now have granular control over your render jobs. Love a specific worker's speed and style? Want to skip an underperforming one on a large batch? Use these new prompt flags to curate your own personal Supernet:

We’ve rolled out two major upgrades for our Fast Worker community. First, an **enhanced management dashboard** with new charting that gives you a daily breakdown of your earnings by token type. Second, for those who want maximum control, we’ve published new documentation on [Advanced Configuration](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-fast-worker/sogni-fast-worker-advanced-configuration) to fine-tune which models your rig hosts and how it operates on the network.

*For Stakers: Secure Your Share of the Airdrop*

*For Artists: Take Control of the Supernet*

- Target specific workers with --workers=WORKER_USERNAME
- Skip specific workers with --skip-workers=WORKER_USERNAME

*For Workers: A Powerful New Dashboard & Advanced Config*

## Two DePINs, One Vision 🤝

We linked up with Aethir because of the same brain, same mission: open, community-first, no walled gardens. To kick it off, we ran a one-time airdrop (now closed) that let Aetherians ape into Sogni via a special NFT; instant perks like priority access, Spark savings, and a future gated Discord channel. If you caught the drop, welcome to the fast lane 🫡
