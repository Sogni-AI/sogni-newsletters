Over 50 million renders—and partnerships galore in Testnet Phase 4.

Hi Sogni Creators,

We're genuinely thrilled to see how deeply you've embraced **Testnet**—and now, we're gearing up for something even more extraordinary. Mainnet is just around the corner, packed with powerful new features, groundbreaking models, and a few surprises we can't wait to reveal. Are you ready?

Thanks to your spreading the word about the fastest, cheapest, and most parallel Creative AI platform on the planet, our community has surged to over **378,000 artists**. This incredible milestone has supercharged our confidence, ensuring Sogni’s DePIN Supernet is battle-tested and ready for primetime.

You aren't just early adopters—you’re pioneers. You’re fueling an AI movement built for creators by creators, not controlled by faceless mega-corporations. Together, we're proving that open source AI, when combined with accessibility, intuitive design, and **unmatched decentralized GPU power**, isn't just better—it's unstoppable.

The future of AI creativity belongs to us. All of us.

Onwards,

-MAU

### FEATURE HIGHLIGHTS

## Keep Creating, Even When Life Interrupts

*Sogni Studio & Pocket now reconnects and resumes your creations automatically.*

Creating on the go just got smoother. Whether you get a call, check a message, switch apps, or lose connection—Sogni now automatically reconnects and recovers any images in progress. This is especially helpful on iOS, where backgrounding the app used to cut off in-progress generations. Now, you can step away and return without losing a thing. No more starting over. Just create, reconnect, and continue.

### TESTNET 4.0

## Leaderboard & Fast Worker Things

*Now Two Weeks into Testnet Phase 4.0, the 30-Day Countdown Begins!*

We’re happy to report the Supernet is running the smoothest and fastest it’s ever been during [Testnet Phase 4.0](https://x.com/Sogni_Protocol/status/1907110735030743421) despite ongoing load. Supernet is still seeing 70% of the peak Phase 3.0 load but it's feeling more like 10% load with major enhancements to the model switching and job matching algorithms. This ensures Artists are never left waiting as model demands shift. Countless network upgrades and performance enhancements have been paying off—We're so ready for the next flood of Creatives!

We’ve begun to roll out our next series of worker image updates starting with new [User Configured Cooldown settings for Fast Workers](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-fast-worker/sogni-fast-worker-advanced-configuration#cooldown_every_x_jobs_count-100). Mac Workers, this update will be coming to you soon.

Our [Testnet Staking leaderboard](https://x.com/Sogni_Protocol/status/1910015606675357906) continues to be a [huge success](https://www.sogni.ai/leaderboard#staking). With 138 million testnet tokens staked and burned, that is roughly 138 million renders freed up in the job queue and the Artist leaderboard for new Artists.

If you have been curious about running a Fast Worker on the platform these last 30 tentative days until Mainnet is a great time to experiment with renting a [Fast Worker from Salad](https://docs.salad.com/products/recipes/sogni-flux-worker). Please note that Fast Workers are exclusively earning [Fast Worker Leaderboard points and rank](https://www.sogni.ai/leaderboard#worker-fast) this testnet phase with a 100% testnet token burn on claim. However, with 221 Fast Workers ranked so far this Testnet Phase every worker will be guaranteed an airdrop. Just be sure to review the [Terms and Conditions](https://www.sogni.ai/leaderboard#tc).
