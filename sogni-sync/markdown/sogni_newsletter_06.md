Hello Sogni Creators,

This week we’re happy to report new support for [[10 more Nvidia GPUs]](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-fast-worker/about-sogni-fast-worker#prerequisites-to-run-a-fast-worker) on our Fast Worker software. Got a 4070 Ti Super or an older 3090 kicking around? Get it online and earning, it’s now fully supported on the network! Our Fast Worker can also be run on [GPU rental services].

The Sogni Supernet is meant to be a decentralized global hub for creative AI and this week we’re humbled to see our platform taking off in some unexpected places. (Hello 🇧🇷 fans, we see you!)

Users from more than 120 countries are now participating as Artists and Worker Nodes in our Testnet. We’re stoked to be kickstarting our Creative AI Supernet with a truly global audience.

We’re now less than 6 weeks from our Sogni Mainnet launch and we couldn’t be more excited! The [[word is getting out]](https://x.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1892169058407063816).

### TESTNET

## It’s the FINAL COUNTDOWN

*Four leaderboards are now live with 40,000,000 $SOGNI at stake*

With our 2nd million generations under our belt in record time our leaderboard activity has been intense! We’ve had a host of updates to further support a fun, fair, and rewarding competition. Here’s a recap:

- Introduced the 4th leaderboard: Fast Worker - 2x’d airdrop allocations from 20M to 40M tokens - Each leaderboard now displays daily value increases in green above lifetime values - Each leaderboard now has date navigation to go back in time. All the way back to the start of testnet! - Ranked accounts that will be disqualified from contests per T&Cs due to bulk artificial referrals and other overt attempts to game ranks unfairly are now flagged with an indicator. A reminder that March 31 will be the snapshot date for Sogni Testnet participant airdrops and leaderboard rewards. Airdrops are scheduled to occur the first week of April. There is no Base Mainnet Sogni token until our Mainnet launch so be wary of any imposters.
