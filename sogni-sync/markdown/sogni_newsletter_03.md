# Supernet goes Autonomous!?
*More open source goodness for your business and projects*

---

Hello Sogni Creators,

The release of **DeepSeek R1**, an open-source AI model matching ChatGPT's performance, signals a critical shift: **AI's future is open and user-controlled.**

This aligns perfectly with what we're building at Sogni—a **decentralized GPU network** that puts Creative AI in your hands. We don't need $100B corporate GPU networks when we have the power of [DePIN](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/decentralized-physical-infrastructure-network-depin-explained). Just as DeepSeek democratizes large language AI, Sogni democratizes creative computing power through our community powered network. We'll continue to integrate these open-source solutions to enhance your creative workflows—from intelligent prompt enhancement to model personalization and training.

Today, we're excited to announce three developments advancing this vision:

- Sogni Supernet SDK launch on Eliza - Major SDK updates - New strategic partnerships

Let's dive in!
