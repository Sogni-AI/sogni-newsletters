## 🪩🌈 Rave to Mainnet

**🎤 Sogni Mainnet is Rave**

We linked up with some heavy‑hitting creators to yap about what’s really going down behind Sogni’s Mainnet launch— and turned it into a rave! Over 3,500 Sognians showed up in their best rave‑fit. [Give it a listen](https://x.com/Sogni_Protocol/status/1937967787114414286)

## 🪩🌈 Join the Rave

We told you already, Sognians turned up with their best rave drips for our TGE Party Space. But any wildly memorable raves last for days. Sogni is not done partying and you can still join this beautiful chaos by hitting up our vibe-coded Photobooth app. Choose between 🪩🌈✨ Candy Raver , Crown Drip , Space Bot , Space Slothi , Tarot Glitch , Tribal Bruh , Tron Don , Y2 K Raver Kid , 4 A M Fingers🪩🌈✨

## 🚀 Mainnet Migration

To migrate your account to Mainnet, just log in using your existing username and password; it’s automatic! Most bugs have been fixed, so if you had trouble before, give it another try.

Once you’re in, you’ll be able to claim your 9 months of Testnet airdrops and NFT badge awards if you’re eligible. Just note: if you didn’t render at least one image during Testnet, you’ll need to create a new Mainnet account since there was nothing to migrate.

With Mainnet live, all token balances have reset, so make sure you log in to see your fresh start and grab your daily boost.

## 🏆 30M SOGNI Leaderboard & Staking

The first Mainnet leaderboard is massive with 30 million SOGNI up for grabs, which is three times bigger than Testnet. Rewards go to the top 2,500 spots, so get in there.

The new Staking Leaderboard is live too. The more weeks you stake in this weekly staking pool, the more exponential the Staking Power points you earn on the Staking leaderboard. 20% of the prize pool is reserved for stakers. All tokens will automatically unstake by August 11 when Staking v3 starts.

Side note: You can only stake SOGNI, not Spark points.

## ⚡ SOGNI & Spark

In case you missed it, we’ve already got our users acquainted with Spark, our render credit alternative for non-crypto natives (and those who only care about creating and nothing else).

And now that we have your full attention, let’s quickly remind you Sogni dual-token system:

🔸SOGNI is the on-chain utility token that powers staking, rewards, governance, and deeper ecosystem access.

🔸Spark Points are stable, non-transferable credits you earn or buy in-app, perfect for creators who just want to make art without touching crypto.

The price of the SOGNI token will fluctuate on Mainnet, as it reflects the average market price across exchanges. This means the amount of SOGNI tokens required to pay for the same Supernet job can vary over time for an Artist. Spark Points are introduced to avoid this exposure to price fluctuations. One Spark Point is always pegged to the cost of a base render job, and that never changes.

## What happens to Testnet tokens

If you noticed your Spark or SOGNI balances reset, don’t worry. This was announced ahead of the transition and applies to all **Testnet tokens**, which held no real value and have now been cleared.

From now on, all activity runs on real SOGNI tokens and Spark Points with real value.

Sogni remains **free to use**, with daily boosts, ongoing rewards, worker mode, and new ways to earn both Spark Points and SOGNI tokens on mainnet.
