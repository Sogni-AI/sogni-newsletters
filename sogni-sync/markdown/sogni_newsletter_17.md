# Season 4, Viral Hits, and The Arrival of Video

---

Hi Sognians!

November was a month of leveling up. We scrubbed the leaderboards to protect honest creators, launched Season 4 with a bang, and watched the community go absolutely viral on social media.

From running out of photo paper in Dubai to hitting nearly half a million views on our latest campaign, the momentum has been undeniable.

And now that we are in December? It's time to make things move. **Sogni Video is arriving this month.**

Let's look back at a wild month and ahead to a massive December.

— The Sogni Team


## Season 4 ending soon: 10M Tokens Up for Grabs ⚖️

The race is on. We have **10,000,000 SOGNI tokens** in the prize pool for Season 4 ending in 5 days and 20 hours. This massive pool is available every single season, waiting to be claimed by creators, workers, and stakers.

To ensure a fair fight, we kicked off the season by removing over **1,700 bot and spam accounts**. We cleared out the bulk farmers so the rewards go to the real community. Stay tuned for Season 6 containing bonus awards on Etherlink as Sogni continues to go cross chain!

**Season 4 Highlights (Active Now):**

The field is level and the prize pool is massive. Go claim your share.

- **Fixed Artist Rewards:** See exactly what you earn per rank.
- **Premium Spark:** Now gets a **10x multiplier**.
- **Real-Time Staking:** Points accrue *every second*.

## 150 Million Creations 🚀

We hit a massive milestone this month. The Sogni Supernet has now powered over **150,000,000 creations**.

That is 150 million moments of inspiration, iteration, and artistic expression from this community. Thank you for building with us.

## Photobooth: Viral Hits & Winter Event ❄️

We teamed up with **Gimi.co** last month to see what happens when we let you loose with the Photobooth. We saw massive spikes in brand awareness across Instagram, X, and TikTok with **458,994 Total Views** and over **48k engagements**.

**New: The Winter Event is Live** We are keeping the momentum going. The **Sogni Winter Photobooth** is now open.

We have integrated 30 "live photo" video styles to showcase the upcoming Wan 2.2 video capabilities. Dive in, transform your photos, and submit them to the Public Gallery.

## App Updates: Speed & Polish 📲

While you were creating, the dev team was shipping. Sogni Web and our native apps got major upgrades in November.

**Sogni Web: Bandwidth Saver** Sogni Supernet now offers the option to receive high-quality JPGs. They are 5-10x smaller than PNGs, making batch renders feel instant. You can toggle between JPG and PNG formats in the **Advanced** menu.

**Sogni Studio & Pocket:** We released a focused update centered on speed and clarity:

- **Faster Launch:** App startup and Worker Mode initialization are significantly quicker.
- **Better Organization:** Chroma models are now split into two distinct groups in the Model Explorer.
- **Clearer Rewards:** We enhanced the Rewards view and updated the Premium Spark screen to clearly display the 10x leaderboard multiplier.
- **Polish:** Optimized settings view and miscellaneous performance and bug fixes.

## Events: Dubai, Nosana & TezTalks 🌍

Mauvis and the team took over Function1 in Dubai. Demand was so high we ran out of materials by noon. The mainstream is ready for Web3 ownership without the friction.

Mauvis joined the Nosana team to discuss the "AI Renaissance." Key takeaway: Open-source models like DeepSeek R1 are removing the moat for proprietary giants, and utility is the only real defense against market bubbles.

Mauvis joined host Stu to explore Sogni's roots in Fortify Labs and why Tezos/Etherlink became our home. A deep dive into the philosophy of AI in 2025.

## Sogni Video Arrives in December 🎬

We hinted that video was coming in the Season 4 announcement. Here are the specifics.

We are officially launching **Sogni Video** this month with a full suite of features powered by **Wan 2.2**:

**How to get ready:**

Get your best generations ready. You are going to want them for this.

That's a wrap for November. With Season 4 underway, video tools dropping this month, and the community growing faster than ever, there has never been a better time to be a Sognian.
