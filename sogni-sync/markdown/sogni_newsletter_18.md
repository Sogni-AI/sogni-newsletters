# 2025: The YearSogni Came Alive

---

January 2026 Edition

From 1 million to 150 million creations, $4M raised, and a community-owned AI toolkit now running on 1,000+ GPUs including H100s, B200s, and RTX 5090s, **2025 was the year Sogni proved the Supernet works at scale.**

If you want the full story of how we got here, you can explore the interactive 2025 wrap-up at [2025.sogni.ai](https://2025.sogni.ai).

Here's where things go from here.

## 2026: What's Next

Hey creator,

If 2025 was about proving the Supernet works, **2026 is about seeing what you do with it.**

### Full video, everywhere

- Video is rolling out across all Sogni apps so you can move between image, video, and audio without switching tools.
- Video transition, motion transfer, music-synced edits, longer clips, and better controls are coming online as tools you'll love to use.

### Profiles, social, and discovery

- Artist profiles will give you a home base in the network: your work, your style, your links, all in one place.
- You'll be able to follow creators, browse an Explore page, and see what the community is making in real time.
- Get gigs, share prompts, settings, and workflows so "How did you make that?" becomes "Here, remix this."

### Vibe coding upgrades

- The SDK is getting a proper vibe-coding starter app: auth, payments, and other boilerplate pre-wired so you can focus on the fun part.
- Better docs, more examples, and hackable templates so shipping a Sogni-powered app feels like a weekend project.

### Hackathons, bounties, and Creator Program

- More structured ways to build with us: hackathons, bounties for apps the ecosystem needs, and clear paths from "experiment" to "featured."
- The Creator Program is getting better rewards, more spotlight, and long-term support for the people already pushing Sogni further.

### LLMs + Sogni + everything else

- LLM support is coming into the SDK and apps so you can chain language, image, and video in a single flow with agents that storyboard, generate, and iterate with you.
- Under the hood, more tools for custom pipelines, automations, and "I built this whole thing in an afternoon" style projects.

### More models, more styles, more control

- New image and video models will keep landing like **Flux.2, Kimi K2**, and loads more. Plus more stylized options, and deeper control over consistency and characters.
- The goal is to give you the right levers when you need them and stay out of the way when you don't.

If 2025 felt big, it was still just foundation. **The network is battle-tested. The tools work. The community is here.**

2026 is where things get weird, fun, and genuinely new. What happens next is less about what Sogni can do and more about what *you* decide to build with it.

Thanks for joining us on this wild journey and we hope you have a very **Happy New Year!**
