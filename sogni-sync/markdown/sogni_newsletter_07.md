Dear Sogni Creators,

Every day, we’re not just setting records—we’re **shattering them.** 🚀

Recently, the Sogni Supernet hit a massive milestone: **4 million images generated**—and counting! To put things into perspective:

**🔥 From 2M to 3M in just four days.

🔥 Over 360K images rendered in a single day.

🔥 An average of 4+ images per second, every second. **

This explosive growth comes alongside +20% more GPU Workers signing up to contribute power and our most requested feature: [Custom Aspect Ratios & Sizes](#shape-vision). Now you can shape your vision with precision—creating everything from cinematic landscapes to perfect squares, all optimized for your specific medium.

Plus, we've boosted Standard model resolution to **1024px** (up from 786px), giving your creations more detail and clarity than ever before.

The creative revolution is happening right now, and you're at the forefront. Dive into this month's newsletter to discover how these new tools can transform your workflow and see what our thriving community is creating.

Let's push the boundaries together,

## 🚀 Sogni at ETHDenver 2025

*A Game-Changing Experience!*

*Sogni team at ETH Denver: Camilo, Mark, Cole and Alejandro.*

**ETHDenver 2025** was an incredible opportunity for **Sogni AI** to showcase our vision for **AI-powered creativity and decentralized innovation**. Over the course of the event, we connected with **developers, artists, and Web3 pioneers**, sharing insights on **Supernet processing, AI-driven art tools, and the future of decentralized creative economies**. From engaging discussions to hands-on demos, our presence at ETHDenver reinforced our mission to empower creators worldwide.

A huge thank you to everyone who joined us, tested our latest features, and contributed to the conversation! This is just the beginning—**stay tuned for what’s next!** 🚀✨

## 🚀 Sogni in Space(s)

*Sharing more juicy alpha in the latest X Livestream*

In our latest Space, we revealed our **new record live: 3M (and counting) images generated!** We also discussed our recent announcement about securing **a (very) rare spot** in **CoinMarketCap’s CMCLabs Accelerator Program,** which only a handful of projects have access to. And this is just the beginning.

As we gear up for our Mainnet launch and double our airdrop to 40M (because sharing is caring and, mathematically, it just makes sense), the Sogni team couldn’t be prouder. Our infrastructure is absolutely crushing it, generating millions of images during Testnet alone. Missed the action? Catch the full roundtable and hear our community’s burning questions! 🚀✨

## Our First Twitter Giveaway

*🚀 Sogni’s First Twitter Giveaway Was a Hit!*

We kicked off our first-ever **Twitter giveaway** with a bang, offering **100 $USDC** to the most impressive Sogni creation—and wow, did our community deliver! **Massive congratulations to SOL,** our first giveaway winner! 🏆🔥

*Winning creation on Twitter by @Rohan87630883*

The response was so incredible that we decided to go even bigger—so we launched another giveaway, this time with a 1,000 $USDC prize pool split among 10 winners. And let’s just say… it’s only Day 2 of the announcement, and we’re already crushing it numbers-wise.

We’re hyped to see all the insane creations rolling in—keep’em coming! If you haven’t submitted yet, now’s your chance. Who’s taking home the next win? 👀
