Dear Sogni Creators,

Our Testnet Phase 3.0 ended with a bang on March 31 and we’ve reached our first summit-what a view it is. **40 million Supernet renders via 700+ community GPUs. vibrant community of 330,000 creators continuing to generate around 1.3 million images every single day with the power of the Sogni Supernet**.

So what’s next? Like every great climb, reaching the first peak isn’t the end—it’s the beginning. The truly amazing traction our Creative AI DePIN network has received over the last few months has opened doors to a really amazing Mainnet launch for both the network and it’s token. This is great news for us and great news for you, early network participants.

The first airdrop snapshot is locked in and to keep this amazing Supernet activity going as preparations for Mainnet are underway we have [[introduced a final Testnet Phase 4.0 with a new leaderboard and an additional 10 million token airdrop.]](https://x.com/Sogni_Protocol/status/1907110735030743421) Unlike our main Testnet which lasted 7 months, this bonus testnet is tentatively scheduled for ~6 weeks.

You may continue to use the platform completely for free and earn some major additional Mainnet tokens.

Mainnet is on the horizon.This is your moment to look back at how far we’ve come and get ready for what’s next. Because we’re not just creating images—we’re rewriting how creativity thrives on the blockchain.

Let’s keep climbing.

Let’s build together.

Let’s make it epic.

### TESTNET 4.0

## 🎯 Final Testnet Phase: Claim Your Share of 10M $SOGNI️

*The leaderboard is on fire—earn, climb, and claim your spot before it’s too late.*

As of UTC Midnight, March 31, 2025 we’ve officially closed Testnet Phase 3.0 and entered Testnet Phase 4.0—the shortest and most focused phase to date, lasting just 6 weeks. To mark this final stretch before Mainnet, we’re allocating an additional 10,000,000 $SOGNI Token airdrop exclusively for Phase 4.0 leaderboard participants!

View all the details on our [[Twitter thread]](https://x.com/Sogni_Protocol/status/1907110735030743421) which covers how both 40M and 10M airdrops will be executed.

Our Testnet 3.0 leaderboard results are now available [[here]](https://www.sogni.ai/leaderboard-testnet-3#artist). The snapshot is final, but the processing of leaderboard outcomes are still underway, including the additional columns for the participation metric and final awards by rank column.

Check out the [[Testnet 4.0 Leaderboard]](https://www.sogni.ai/leaderboard#artist) and be sure to review the [[Terms & Conditions]](https://www.sogni.ai/leaderboard#tc) as there are some noteworthy changes for this final round!

Of note, we’ve added a new way to compete: the staking leaderboard. Your rank is based solely on the number of tokens you stake. It’s an easy leaderboard to rank for Phase 3.0 kingpins that have a lot of tokens left over. For new Artist participants the best place to rank is the Artist leaderboard! Also noteworthy is that Fast Worker nodes have moved to a 100% burn during claim for this round. Fast Worker rewards will be well worth the dedication to a single leaderboard. Referral leaderboard points have also been adjusted to be based on referee participation to discourage bogus signups.

If you haven’t tried running your own Fast Worker virtually yet, check out the new Sogni Flux and Stable Diffusion worker [(Recipes)](https://docs.salad.com/products/recipes/sogni-stable-diffusion-worker) now available directly on salad.com! It’s roughly $0.346 USD/hr pay-as-you-go to rent an uber powerful Nvidia RTX 4090 to run jobs on the Supernet. Accounts that run both Artist and Worker from the same account will continue to be given a priority boost in request queues.

We also have some noteworthy updates to our Fast Worker real-time health and job analytics pages at

**Stake your tokens. Climb the ranks. Secure your share**.
