# Hope You Had a Great October! 🎃

---

**This year is flying by and last month brought amazing updates and milestones we're proud to share with you.**

A new leader joined our team. We took Sogni to one of crypto's biggest stages. We watched the next generation of creators discover what happens when human taste meets AI's fluency.

And your Halloween creations? Absolutely phenomenal. Let's dive in.

## Meet Your New Head of Growth

Hey everyone! Josh here.

You may recognize me from Sogni's YouTube tutorials or my work as a Web3 and AI KOL. I've been using AI tools daily for over three years now, back before ChatGPT even existed.

Why am I here? Because Sogni is *f*cking* rad. You can see it in the products and feel it in the community. This is a team of creators building for creators who want true ownership, real privacy, and tools that amplify what makes them unique.

My job is simple: amplify what you're already doing. Expect more resources. More ways to showcase your work. More opportunities to turn your creativity into something extraordinary.

This journey is about you. I'm here to help you win. 🤘

## TOKEN2049: “Sogni Was Everywhere”

If you were in Singapore last month, you probably ran into us. Our team executed 14 activations across five days—sometimes three at once across the city—from morning to night.

Multiple people told us we were “literally everywhere” at every major event. That wasn't an accident. Special shoutout to [Natx](https://x.com/natxwang), our Ecosystem Growth Lead, who's been doing an amazing job forging partnerships and building our close relationship with the Base community throughout Asia. ❤️

Over 900 people RSVP’d to our flagship [Dreamhaus event at Overeasy Bar](https://luma.com/dreamhaus). We partnered with our good friends at TzApac to make it happen across the bay from the iconic Marina Bay Sands. Mauvis ran a vibe‑coding session and we had two printers going nonstop because people couldn’t get enough of [Photobooth](https://photobooth.sogni.ai/). The energy was electric.

*Building With the Right Partners*

Heartfelt thanks to Base, TzApac, Etherlink, and Nosana. They don't treat creators as marketing assets—they treat them as the soul of this movement, backing it up with action, resources, and real presence.

These are the partners who understand what we're building: tools that create real value for real people. Stay tuned. The next era of open‑source AI is coming.

## Creative Collisions at RIT: The First Generation of Co‑Creation

Our benevolent CEO, Mauvis, spent three days at Rochester Institute of Technology for Creative Collisions mid‑month. What he saw was fascinating: a generational shift in how young creators approach AI.

Some students had valid concerns about environmental impact, copyright, and ethics. Others dove in fearlessly. Over those three days, something clicked: students who embraced AI didn't lose their voice—they amplified it. Work that felt alive. Guided by human taste, expressed through machine fluency.

Special thanks to RIT's Program Directors Mike Strobert and Jason Arena, and Associate Professor Adam Smith for creating space for honest dialogue about AI's role in creativity.

**The insight:** AI isn't replacing creativity. It's expanding the canvas.

## Photobooth Goes Full Halloween (Plus Updates Across the Suite)

If there's a holiday perfectly suited for Photobooth, it's Halloween—and we leaned in hard.

In preparation for our Halloween contest, our vibe‑coding maestro and CTO, [Mark](https://x.com/fishmongr), completely revamped core workflows with tons of UX improvements.

And the costumes? He added over 40 Halloween styles—on top of the 200+ styles already in Photobooth. Here are a few ready to go:

## Quick Hits Across Sogni

**Sogni Web:** [Paintover](https://app.sogni.ai/create) now works with Guide Images and Kontext so you can draw over existing images or draw from scratch for even more creative control.

We also added ControlNet support for models like Canny, InPaint, and LineArt so you get the control you need.

**Sogni Studio & Pocket:** Style quick search makes finding the perfect aesthetic instant. Just start typing and boom—you're there.

We added new metadata embedding that automatically saves your generation settings right into exported images. And of course, some nice UI improvements for Mac OS Tahoe and iOS 26, among other stability and performance improvements. 💪

## November Is Here: Creator Showcase + Season 4 Is Live

Four weeks. Four challenges. The fourth week is a special finale. We've already kicked off Week 1 with “Logo in Their Fall Era,” reimagining brands through autumn aesthetics. Top 3 winners each week earn Premium Spark and SOGNI tokens. We're also crowning a Creator of the Month.
