*Coming in hot with the force of 1,000,000 images a day*

Dear Sogni Creators,

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy. But here's my number, so call me maybe: **12,016,877**

This number isn’t a phone number, but it is a crazy number. It’s how many images y’all have created during our little Testnet!

Let me share some other crazy numbers with you:

1) **150,304** – The number of current Testnet users.

2) **326**– The number of Mac and Nvidia GPUs contributing their compute to drive our people-powered Supernet.

3) **1M+** – The number of artful creations produced every 24 hours.

Weren’t we just celebrating **10k artists** last newsletter? Yes, lol. We always knew that if we built it, *they* would come—and it looks like the’re finally here. 🙂

Why all the buzz? I’m sure our [[official fundraising announcement]](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sogni-ai-secure-2m-in-funding-to-build-an-ai-decentralized-gpu-network1034464651) had something to do with it. 🙏

We are eternally grateful for our backers and early testnet supporters. ❤️❤️

### FEATURE HIGHLIGHT

## ⚡ Real-Time Generation: Create at the Speed of Thought

*Instant full renders as you adjust your settings.*

Did you know Sogni Studio Pro lets you generate images in real-time as you tweak your settings? If you're using Flux, LCM, or SDXL-Turbo models, an often-overlooked option allows you to trigge a full render instantly with every change. These models are fast—producing images in less than 5 seconds—so you can fine-tune your results without breaking your creative flow.

**How to enable it:**

Tap the lightning button (⚡️) next to the Steps and Guidance knobs. Once activated, every setting change will trigger a new render automatically.

**Pro Tip:**

To refine the same image as you adjust settings, lock the seed 🌱🔒. If the seed is set to shuffle, each tweak will generate a completely different image.

This feature is perfect for rapid iteration, experimenting with subtle changes, and getting closer to your creative vision—without manually triggering each generation. Plus, by seeing how every adjusment affects the final image, you'll naturally develop a deeper understanding of how different settings work—making you faster and more precise in achieving the results you want. Try it out and let us kow what you create! ⚡️✨

### TESTNET

## Leaderboard Updates from the Fast Worker perspective️

By now you may have heard that the Nvidia RTX 4090 Fast Worker is the King of the Supernet. Pumping out upwards of 20,000 image renders a day, and equivalenttestnet Sogni tokens, running one of these directly or [[virtually]](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-fast-worker/about-sogni-fast-worker) certainly puts you in the fast lane in both community service and community reward.

As our Testnet enters its final stages we have introduced a new claiming system for Fast Supernet worker earnings. Network fees on withdrawal help sustain the network, contribute to upcoming stakig pool rewards, model creator and trainers fund, and a portion to token burn which reduces token circulating supply.

Despite these network supporting fees, we expect that running a Fast Worker dedicated to Creative AI on the Supernet should be the most lucrative DePIN work for these GPUs afer Mainnet with tentative real-world estimates expected to be around $12.50 - $25 a day or $375 - $750 mo in tokens per details in the above docs.

In other Leaderboard news, we have been combating some excessive account creation spamming, artificial referral system / token farming, and some excess imagejob spamming for leaderboard points. Our anti-botting detection has flagged 100 of the top 400 referral leaderboard users this week due to these activities.

Some token rewards have been adjusted down as we get closer to mainnet, except Daily Boost which will remain high to encourage daily activity:

Verify Email Reward: 2000 -> 500

Referer Reward: 500 -> 125

Referee Reward: 250 -> 125

Daily Boost: 200 -> 200

This saves more room for all you legitimate users for airdrops, rewards, and performance on the network 🙏 ❤️ !
