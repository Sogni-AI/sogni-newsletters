# Sogni Retrospective, New Tools, Competitions & Developer Rewards

---

Hi Sogni Creators, With the end of Testnet only a few weeks away we're excited to share that some major exchange listings are being secured and TGE is looking locked in for July. We also released an extensive recap of where we’ve been and where we’re going after Mainnet—see our [latest Medium article](https://medium.com/sogni/sogni-ai-eight-months-of-fueling-the-people-powered-future-of-creative-ai-187af3719f7e). This week we're excited to share new developments across our platform from the launch of our latest open-sourced Photobooth superapp to our new Sogni Studio PaintOver tool that can give you new levels of creative control.

There has been a lot of truly exciting buzz in our Creative AI space. Join us in our next weekly Discord Office Hours this Friday May 30, 8am PT where we’ll talk shop on more big things in store at Sogni [» Add to calendar](http://news.sogni.ai/sogni-office-hours.ics)
