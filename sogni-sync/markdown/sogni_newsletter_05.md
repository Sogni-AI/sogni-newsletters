# Ready, Set, Render: Sogni’s Nvidia GPU Leaderboard Kicks Off Monday🏁
*More power for your renders and 2x the airdrop rewards*

---

Hello Sogni Creators,

Big news, our Sogni Supernet Fast Worker software just went live for public testnet users and you’re the first to hear! Now you, yes you, can get that Nvidia 4090 gaming PC sitting around gathering dust running on the Supernet and earning testnet tokens.

With the release of public Fast Workers comes a brand new public leaderboard. With 6 weeks until tentative Mainnet we are also raising the stakes *significantly* across **all** leaderboards!

We’re grateful to the 170+ GPU’s who have signed up to power Sogni Supernet so far and the nearly 4,000 artists who are using it. We are still early with so much in store.

Onwards and upwards Sognonians!

Not only can you run this new worker app on your local gaming rigs but Nvidia-4090-less Sognians can also deploy it on GPU rental platforms like Salad.

### TESTNET

## Leaderboards rewards heat up!

*Sogni’s Nvidia GPU Leaderboard Kicks Off Monday🏁*

With the release of our Sogni Fast Worker we’re introducing a second Worker leaderboard just for the Fast Supernet. This leaderboard will start fresh on Monday 2025/02/17 so get your worker installed and up and running by then for the best chances of staying on top!

As an extra incentive and thanks to our community we are DOUBLING leaderboard rewards. The aggregate airdrop amount that will be dropped between the 4 leaderboards will climb to 40,000,000 tokens when the leaderboard is updated on Monday!

A reminder that March 31 will be the snapshot date for Sogni Testnet participant airdrops and leaderboard rewards. Airdrops are still scheduled to occur in April. **There is no Base Mainnet Sogni token until our Mainnet launch so be wary of any imposters. We will share the official Contract Address when it becomes available.**
