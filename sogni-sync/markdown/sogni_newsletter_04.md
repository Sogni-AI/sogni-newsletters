### NEW RELEASES

## SwipeFlow. Infinite Creativity.

*Now on Sogni Pocket. “Endless” Batch Creation for iOS.*

Swipe left to see your next generation, up to save it to your phone’s Photo Library, swipe right to go back in history. It’s so fast and intuitive that we think you’ll really dig it.

We’re thrilled to introduce a powerhouse update to Sogni Pocket, allowing you to generate up to 16 images at once—perfect for bringing your wildest ideas to life in record time.

But that’s not all. Meet SwipeFlow, a game-changing new review workflow unique to Sogni Pocket. SwipeFlow intelligently prerenders and loads your next images ahead of time so you can effortlessly flick through your next creations without a wait. Enable alongside Fast Supernet processing and experience an immersive, uninterrupted swiping adventure that keeps your creativity moving at full speed.

## More Dynamic Prompting Features

*Powerful syntax to ideate and explore new concepts swiftly and easily*

Using the new Random “@” option in your prompt to randomize subjects, places, styles and/or moods before narrowing in on your desired concept

We’ve introduced Cyclical, Random, and Weighted Random options to our Dynamic Prompt samplers. Coupled with batch generations of up to 512 images at a time it’s never been easier to explore a wide spectrum of images, perfect for brainstorming and exploring diverse ideas. Ask your favorite AI assistant to generate a beast of a Dynamic Prompt like above and tell them Sogni sent you! Freeze the seed and you can ideate on the same imagery while only tweaking certain elements like hair color, artistic style, or music instrument.

## Climbing the Leaderboards

We’re happy to announce that our Sogni Fast Worker installer will move out of closed beta into public access next week! This new installer will be limited to Windows / Linux machines with 64gb of ram and an Nvidia RTX 4090 or higher GPU. Fast Supernet Workers will have a new and separate leaderboard from the current Relaxed Supernet Worker leaderboard so all testnet participants can reap the benefits of having workers running on either or both networks with separate rewards.

A reminder that March 31 will be the snapshot date for Sogni Testnet participant airdrops and leaderboard rewards. Airdrops are still scheduled to occur in April. **There is no Base Mainnet Sogni token until our Mainnet launch so be weary of any imposters. We will share the official Contract Address when it becomes available. **
