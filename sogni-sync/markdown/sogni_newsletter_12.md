### TIPS&TRICKS

## How to Create a Storyboard with Sogni AI: Visual Planning Made Easy

### TESTNET 4.0

## Updates From Testnet 4.0

*Last Call for Testnet Fast Worker NFTs!*

We've allowlisted the last remaining Fast Worker NFTs bringing the grand total to 999 total supply on testnet. We are looking to add Nvidia 5xxx series card support over the next week so secure your Fast Worker NFT if you have a RTX 5090 ready!

**Fast Worker System Requirements:** Mint only if you have a Windows/Linux machine with a [supported Nvidia card](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-fast-worker/about-sogni-fast-worker#prerequisites-to-run-a-fast-worker)—minting Fast Worker NFT without Nvidia hardware won’t give you any advantages.

**Mac Workers:** As a reminder any Mac with an M1 Chip and 16gb of ram or higher can be a Relaxed Supernet worker. You’ll just need to have the free [Pro version](https://www.sogni.ai/studio#download) of Sogni Studio installed. Then you can simply put your worker into *Enter Worker mode and Earn* mode to earn tokens while you sleep! No NFT required.
