# Racing toward a Decentralized Future
*A Note from Mauvis, CEO of Sogni*

Hello Sogni Creators,

At Sogni, we're not just building tools and protocols – we're championing a revolution in creative technology. Our mission is to empower artists while protecting their privacy and supporting the open-source community that makes AI innovation possible. We believe in fair compensation for model creators and trainers, and we're committed to maintaining a free version of Sogni for everyone, always.

As we prepare to launch our utility token in the next few months we're excited to share how it will further democratize AI art creation so that every contribution—from training new models, to running worker nodes, to building new apps—feeds back into this vibrant ecosystem.

Until then, have a blast exploring our newest features, from dynamic batch prompts to in-depth InPaint tutorials. Thank you for being part of a future where artistic empowerment comes first through open source models and people power.

**Let’s dive in!**

### FEATURE SPOTLIGHT

## Combination Prompts

*Dynamic Variations, Simplified*

Creative AI is all about ideation: it’s a multi-step exploration. The faster you can ideate and create the faster you can reach your ultimate vision. With **combination prompts,** Sogni lets you add dynamic variations to your requests, unlocking more creativity in less time. Use the {} syntax with the | character to add variations in your prompt, style, and negative prompt fields during batch rendering. This means you can explore multiple subjects, styles, scenes, or other elements—all in a single batch render.

For example: “A {cat|dog} in space” will create two unique prompts: “A cat in space” and “A dog in space”

Whether you're creating NFT collections, searching for the perfect style, exploring subject transformations, or crafting diverse scenes, combination prompts make every batch an efficient and exciting journey in creativity.
