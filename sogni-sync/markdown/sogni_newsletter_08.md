### FEATURE HIGHLIGHT

## Your Power. Your Rewards.

*Turn Your Idle Compute into Earned Tokens With Worker Mode in Sogni Studio Pro.*

Worker Mode in **Sogni Studio Pro** lets you join the **Supernet and earn rewards** by sharing your idle compute power with fellow artists. Your Mac will generate images for the community, and in return, you'll receive **token rewards**—all while keeping full control over your Mac.

**⚛ One-Click to Start Earning**

Getting started is effortless. Simply go to ***Supernet > Enter Worker Mode and Earn*** from the top menu. Sogni will switch to a **mini-player mode**, and with one click, your Mac will begin processing jobs that match the models you have installed.

**🔒 Private, Safe, and Non-Intrusive**

Worker Mode is designed with **privacy and efficiency** in mind. It runs in the background without slowing you down, so you can continue using your Mac for other tasks.

**🏆 Climb the Relaxed Worker Leaderboard**

The more you contribute, the higher your ranking. Top workers will be rewarded with a juicy airdrop of SOGNI tokens shortly after the TGE.

**💰 Use Your Earnings Your Way**

Watch your balance grow and use your earned tokens to generate more images in Artist Mode—or withdraw them to your wallet.

**✨ Exclusively in Sogni Studio Pro **

Worker Mode is available only in [Sogni Studio Pro](https://www.sogni.ai/download), which you can download **directly from the Sogni website.**

**Don't have a Mac but have an Nvidia GPU?**[Head on over to our docs to learn how to put it to work](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-fast-worker/running-sogni-fast-worker-locally)

## Tips to Earn More as a Worker

*Optimize Your Setup, Maximize Your Rewards.*

Want to boost your SOGNI token earnings as a Sogni Studio worker in the Relaxed Supernet? This tutorial walks you through three key optimizations to help you earn more efficiently:

**💾 Stay Up-to-Date**

Ensure your Sogni Studio Pro and system software are always updated to access the latest improvements, bug fixes, and optimizations for smoother job processing.

⚡** Optimize Performance** Fine-tune your Mac’s settings for maximum efficiency—adjust power preferences, manage background processes, and keep your system running at peak performance.

**🤖 Expand Your Model Library**

The more models you have installed, the more jobs your worker can accept. Adding popular models increases your chances of processing more requests and earning more tokens.

🤖🤖 Contribute more idle machines with the same Sogni account If you have more than 1 idle Mac, you can run them under the same Sogni account to all earn against the same leaderboard username.

### SOGNI SPOTLIGHT

## Meet Paul Sebastien, Advisor at Sogni

Paul Sebastien is a seasoned executive with a rich background in technology and media. As the former President of Real Vision, he played a pivotal role in enhancing the company's financial media platform. Paul's extensive experience includes leadership roles at Microsoft and Disney, as well as co-creating Udemy for Business. His strategic insights are instrumental in guiding Sogni's mission to revolutionize AI-powered creativity.

*“One of the truly impressive things about the Sogni team and GTM is that they're not only building pro-level AI visual creation tools that anyone can use for free to create any amazing images without the limits and restrictions of the gated mainstream providers - but the even bigger bet powering it all is their powerful DePin-based compute network which grows exponentially as more and more Sogni users create images: the Sogni Supernet. And as this network scales, render speeds increase, more and more computer use cases become possible, and the world benefits from a truly ungated system empowering both image creators and Supernet network participants alike."*

### TESTNET

## Leaderboard University️

*Some Quick Tips For Staying on Top*

With less than 3 weeks until the snapshot we’ve had quite a lot of exciting movement on our airdrop leaderboards and some users are asking how to compete beyond checking in daily and spending their DAILY BOOST worth of tokens. Here are some tips:

**1. Spread the word:** Each email-verified Sogi referral not only increments your Sogni Account on the Referral leaderboard by 1 but also rewards you 500 tokens, and the referee 250 tokens. These add up in giving you ammunition to produce more art and climb the main artist leaderboard.

**2. Run multiple workers:** Some Mac users run Sogni Studio Pro on multiple idle Macs logged into the same Sogni Account to earn against the same username entry on the leaderboard. This is allowed!

**3. Win art contests:** Many top artists participate and win regularly in our weekly Discord art contest. An extra 5,000 - 20,000 tSOgni a week really starts to add up! Our contests now extend to Twitter too, so the more you post, the more rewards you can earn.

**4. Rent a fast worker:** Even if you don’t have an Nvidia GPU to run a Sogni Fast Worker, Sogni allows anyone to run a Fast Worker through GPU cloud rental services like salad.com. Just check out the instructions [[here]](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-fast-worker/running-sogni-fast-worker-remotely). Because Nvidia 4090 GPUs are so powerful, they can easily earn 10,000+ tsogni a day on the network which is a lot of token ammunition to turn around and spend as an artist.

**Please note:** Currently Sogni Accounts are limited to running either Relaxed Worker or Fast Worker but not both under the same account. Please create a new account for Fast Worker if you’re already running a Relaxed worker. Token transfers between accounts can be done through a [[browser wallet]](https://docs.sogni.ai/sogni-studio-pro/how-to-add-your-sogni-wallet-to-metamask).

**Reminder:** The snapshot date for Testnet participant airdrops and leaderboard rewards is March 31. Airdrops are scheduled for the first week of April. There is no Base Mainnet Sogni token until Mainnet launch—beware of imposters.
